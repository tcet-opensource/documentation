# TCET Open Source Documentation Website 

This repository contains the source code of the Documentation Website.

One of the key visions of the TCET Open Source Organization is to provide users of our software and others willing to contribute with access to project documentation for all of our current projects. The organization recognizes the importance of clear and concise documentation when creating open-source software, to ensure it's development is rapid, continous and traceble.

The **Documentation Website** will act as our Organization's website. It will consist of the *documentation of all projects* undertaken by TCET Open Source. The website will also have dedicated *blogs contributed by the community* covering various different interests.

## .env File Setup  

In addition to cloning the repository and setting up the project as described above, you will need to create a .env file to configure certain environment variables. These variables are essential for the proper functioning of the Documentation Website. Here's how you can set up the .env file:

+ Create the .env file: First, create a file named .env in the root directory of your cloned repository.

+ Add API Key and Application ID: Inside the .env file, you'll need to set two important variables: API_KEY and APPLICATION_ID. These variables are used for connecting to external services or APIs that the website may rely on.

```
API_KEY=<your_api_key>
APPLICATION_ID=<your_id>
index=tcetopensource
```

+ API_KEY should be replaced with the actual API key required for your project. Make sure to obtain the API key from the respective service or provider you're using.

+ APPLICATION_ID should be replaced with the unique application ID required for your project. Again, obtain this ID from the relevant service or provider.
