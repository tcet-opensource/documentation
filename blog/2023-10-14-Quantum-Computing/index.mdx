## What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is fundamentally different from traditional computing. Traditional computers use bits as the fundamental unit of data, which can be either 0 or 1. Quantum computing, on the other hand, makes use of quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in numerous states at the same time due to superposition and entanglement principles.

### Superposition 

Superposition enables the linear combination of both 0 and 1 to exist in a qubit, allowing for the concurrent computing of many possibilities. This idea is comparable to flipping a coin and getting both heads and tails at once.

### Entanglement

Another amazing quality of qubits is entanglement. When qubits are entangled, their states are dependent on one another even though they are separated by a great distance. The potential for quicker and more secure communication networks is made possible by this feature.
