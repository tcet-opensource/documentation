## **Storage Partitioning**

   - **Automatic Setup (Recommended):**
   
     The installer defaults to an automatic setup, creating a Fat32 EFI System Partition and a root partition with the ext4 filesystem. This is recommended for most users.

   - **Manual Partitioning (Advanced):**
   
     For advanced users who want complete control over their disk partitions.

     - **Select Disk:**
       Choose the disk where TCET Linux will be installed. This could be your SSD or HDD.

     - **Existing Partitions:**
       If there are existing partitions, you'll see them listed. Decide whether to modify, delete, or keep them.

     - **Create Partitions:**
       - **EFI System Partition (ESP):**
         - Size: Typically around 300MB.
         - Filesystem: FAT32.
         - Mount Point: /boot/efi.
         
       - **Root Partition (/):**
         - Size: Allocate a sufficient amount, at least 20GB.
         - Filesystem: ext4.
         - Mount Point: /.
         
       - **Swap Partition (optional):**
         - Size: Recommended to be equal to or double your RAM.
         - Filesystem: Swap.
         
       - **Home Partition (optional):**
         - Size: As per your storage needs.
         - Filesystem: ext4.
         - Mount Point: /home.

     - **Filesystem and Mount Points:**
       Assign a filesystem (e.g., ext4) and mount points for each partition.

     - **Finalize and Apply:**
       Confirm your choices and apply the changes. Double-check to avoid data loss. 

:::warning
**Important Note for Multiple OS Installation:**
- If you intend to have multiple operating systems on your disk, such as dual-booting with another OS, it is recommended to choose manual partitioning.
- Use **"Erase Full Disk & Install" only if** you are installing **TCET Linux as a Virtual Machine** OR **You Want TCET Linux to be the sole operating system** on your machine. This option will erase the entire disk, including other operating systems and data.
