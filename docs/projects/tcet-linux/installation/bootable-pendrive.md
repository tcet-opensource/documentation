- Now after this there will be a menu box opend which will ask you wether you want to write an ISO image or write the same thing in DD mmode. So what you want to do is select DD mode , this is because in the first option the in ISO image a lot of distribution can't boot in UEFI/BIOS mode , thus DD mode is recommended.

- Now click on OK and a pop up menu will openn which will waarn you that all the data on the usb device is going to be wipped off, so this is where you want to make sure that you have already backed up all the data.

Make sure you have backed up the data in the usb in other device, as once click `READY` the data is going to be wipped off.

### Step 3.

- Now insert the USB stick back into your computer and restart it.
- The BIOS menu should appear with all available drives listed for installation. Select TCET Linux.
- If you can't then restart and press esc button before the windows OS load.
