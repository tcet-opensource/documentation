2. Locate the download section and select the latest TCET Linux ISO image.
3. Download the ISO image to your computer.

## Creating a Bootable USB Drive

Once you have downloaded the TCET Linux ISO image, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive to install TCET Linux on your computer. You can use various tools for this, depending on your current operating system:

- *Windows:* You can use tools like Rufus, Balena Etcher, or Win32 Disk Imager to create a bootable USB drive. Follow the instructions provided by your chosen tool to flash the TCET Linux ISO to the USB drive.

- *Linux:* You can use the 'dd' command to create a bootable USB drive on Linux. Open a terminal and run the following command (replace /dev/sdX with the appropriate drive designation of your USB drive):
  
  ```bash
  sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/tcet-linux.iso of=/dev/sdXÂ status=progress
