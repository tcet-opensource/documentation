In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to download and install TCET Linux on a Virtual Machine (VM). TCET Linux is a customizable Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, suitable for a wide range of use cases. By running it on a VM, you can explore its features without affecting your primary operating system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V) installed on your host machine. In this guide we have considered virtual box as the virtual machine software.
- The TCET Linux ISO image downloaded from the TCET Linux website.

## Steps to Install TCET Linux on a Virtual Machine

### Additional Steps for Arch Linux Hosts

1. **Check your Kernel:**

   Before installing TCET Linux, it's essential to check your Linux kernel version. Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   uname -r
   ```

   This command will display your current Linux kernel version.

2. **Installation Steps based on Kernel:**

   - If you have a regular linux kernel, follow these steps:
     ```bash
     # Install necessary dependencies
     sudo pacman -S linux-headers

     # Install VirtualBox or your preferred VM software
     sudo pacman -S virtualbox

     # Install host modules
     sudo pacman -S virtualbox-host-modules-arch
     ```

   - If you have an LTS (Long-Term Support) or any other kernel, follow these steps:
     ```bash
     # Install necessary dependencies
     sudo pacman -S linux-lts-headers

     # Install VirtualBox or your preferred VM software
     sudo pacman -S virtualbox

     # Install host modules
     sudo pacman -S virtualbox-host-dkms
     ```

### Common Steps:

1. *Create a New Virtual Machine:*

   - Open your Virtual Machine software (e.g., VirtualBox).
   - Click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
   - Choose a name for your VM (e.g., "TCET Linux").
   - Select the appropriate Type and Version (e.g., "Linux" and "Arch Linux 64-bit" if available).
   - Allocate at least 2GB of RAM to the VM.
   - Create a new virtual hard disk with a minimum of 20GB of space.

2. *Configure VM Settings:*

   - Select your TCET Linux VM in the VM manager.
   - Go to "Settings."
   - In the "System" tab, under the "Processor" tab, assign multiple CPU cores if available.
   - In the "Storage" tab, under "Controller: IDE," add the TCET Linux ISO as a bootable CD/DVD.

3. *Start the Virtual Machine:*

   - Start the VM and it will boot from the TCET Linux ISO you attached.
   - You'll see the TCET Linux boot menu. Select "Boot TCET Linux" to begin the installation process.

4. *Follow the Installation Process:*

   - The TCET Linux installer will guide you through the installation process.
   - Choose your preferred language and keyboard layout.
   - Select the "Disk Setup" option to partition your virtual hard disk. You can choose to use the entire disk or create custom partitions.
   - When prompted, choose the desktop environment and software packages you want to install.

5. *Configure Network and User:*

   - Set up your network connection. You can configure both wired and wireless connections during the installation.
   - Create a user account and set a password for it.

6. *Complete the Installation:*

   - Let the installer complete the installation process. It will install the selected packages and set up the system.

7. *Eject the ISO and Reboot:*

   - Once the installation is complete, the VM will prompt you to remove the ISO from the virtual CD/DVD drive.
   - Eject the TCET Linux ISO and reboot the VM.

8. *Log In:*

   - After rebooting, you'll be presented with the login screen.
   - Log in with the username and password you set during the installation.

9. *Post-Installation Setup:*

   - After logging in, follow the post-installation instructions to update the system and configure any additional settings.

Congratulations, you've successfully installed TCET Linux on a Virtual Machine! You can now explore and customize your TCET Linux environment according to your needs and preferences.
