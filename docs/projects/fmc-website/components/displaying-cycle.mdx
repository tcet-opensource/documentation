# Cycle Display
In **Cycle Display** component user will be able to see the break down of the average marks scored by them as tickmarks on various cells.<br />
**As you may see in the image:**

import pic2 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/cycledisplay1.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic2} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
</p>
<br />

**Breakdown of the code is as follows:**

### Column Header 
  
1. `<th>` : We have used `<th>` tag to define the column headers for the  table, which are **"Par\Perf"**, **"E (5)"**, **"VG (4)"**, **"G (3)"**, **"A (2)"**, and **"BA (1)"**.
	
2. We have used class attribute to apply CSS to the cells.
 
	```html title="index.html" {3-4} showLineNumbers
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Par\Perf</th>
			<th class="c">E (5)</th>
			<th class="c">VG (4)</th>
			<th class="c">G (3)</th>
			<th class="c">A (2)</th>
			<th class="c">BA (1)</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	```
### Data Column 
  
1. `<tr>` : We have used `<tr>` element to define a row in an HTML table.
  
2. `<th>` : We have used `<th>` tag to define the column header ie "1 to 5" on line 2.
  
3. `<td>` : We have used `<td>` tag to define the remaining cells. These rows are used as template for adding actual data to the table.   

	```html title="index.html" {1-3} showLineNumbers
	<tr>
		<th>TK (30)</th>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	```
:::tip
Similarly we have implemented next column: **TD (30)** , **LI (10)** , **B (10)** and **C (20)** column.

_After successfully implementing the **[Cycle Display](displaying-cycle)** component of the **[Fill my cycle](https://fillmycycle.tcetmumbai.in/#result)** website, the next step we did was to move forward with the implementation of **[Cycle Result](cycle-result)** component._
