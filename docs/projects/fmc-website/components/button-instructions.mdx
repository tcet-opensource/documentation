# Button and Instructions Section
In this section we will explain you about various **buttons** we have included in **Fill my Cycle** website
and their purpose. We will also introduce you the **instructions** to be followed.

## Theme button
We have included this button on the header section to change the theme of the web to light and dark mode.<br />

**Let's now understand it's code now:**

1. Firstly open **index.html** file.

2. Here we have created `<div>` class called `id` button which has its value as `DARK` and it redirects to **script.js** and this button follows the image showing an icon of half moon which on clicking leads us to the dark theme.

``` html title="index.html"{1-3} showLineNumbers
<div id="btn-mode">
			<div><p id="mode-text">DARK</p></div>
			<div><img id="mode-icon" src="./assets/icons/moon-icon.svg" alt=""></div>
</div>
```
3. Now let's open **script.js**.

4. Here we have used if-else statement here, if darkMode is equal to **false**, it means the dark mode is currently **off.** In that case, the `darkModeProp()` function is called. 

``` js title="script.js" {3,7,9-13,21,23} showLineNumbers
const root = document.documentElement.style;

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	let btnMode = document.getElementById('btn-mode');
	let modetext = document.getElementById("mode-text");
	const modeicon = document.getElementById("mode-icon")
	let darkMode = false;

	btnMode.addEventListener('click', function() {
		if (darkMode == false) {
			darkModeProp();
		  } else {
			lightModeProp();
		  }
	} );
```    

5. Function `darkModeProp` sets the style properties to define the dark mode appearance, updates the mode text to "LIGHT", changes the mode icon to a sun, and sets `darkMode` to **true** and uses the parameters given in the code. If `darkMode` is not equal to ***false*** it means dark mode is currently ***on.*** 

``` js title="script.js" {3,6,7,8} showLineNumbers
const root = document.documentElement.style;

	function darkModeProp() {
		root.setProperty("--lm-bg", "#131414");
		// It's followed by similar parameters defined to obtain Dark Theme
		modetext.innerText = "LIGHT";
		modeicon.src = "./assets/icons/sun-icon.svg";
		root.setProperty("--lm-icon-bg", "brightness(1000%)");
		darkMode = true;
		localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", true);
	}

```
:::tip
In the very same way we have also created for how to switch the user interface back to light mode, just changed the paramters values.

** As you see in the image below:**

import pic5 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/darklightmode.png";
import pic6 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/darkandlightmode1.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic5} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />
<img src = {pic6} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>

## Need help button

We have included this button on the header section. If you click on it then it will direct you to 
the instruction section on the bottom of the website.<br />

** Now lets understand it's code **

1. Overall, the code represents a row with a form that has a heading saying **"Need Help?"** and a **button** when the user clicks leads him to instructions part.

2. The `<div>` class sets the styling and padding of the **Need Help** text , this text is followed by a clickable button.

``` html title="index.html"{5} showLineNumbers
<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12">
			<form class="form-inline" action="" onsubmit="return false">
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mrg">Need Help? <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs instr-ref">Click here to see instructions</button></h5>
				</div>
``` 
:::tip
Using similar logic as above we have created buttons in this section.

** As you see in the image below:**

import pic7 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/instructionbutton.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic7} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>

## New Feature Button
This button will direct you to the instruction section (indication the third point to introduce new feature).<br />
** As you see in the image below:**

import pic8 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/newfeaturebutton.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic8} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>

## Reset button
This button will reset all the data given by the user so that user can use the website again.<br />
** As you see in the image below:**

import pic9 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/reset.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic9} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>

## Manual Check button
This button directs user to cycle display section. We have introduced this button to introduce the 
manual check input mode feature. Here the user can manually tick the cells of cycle display section
as per their requirement.<br />
** As you see in the image below:**

import pic10 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/manualcheckbutton.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic10} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>

## Instructions
Here we have introduced instructions to be followed while using the fill my cycle website.
** As you see in the image below:**<br />

import pic11 from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/instruction.png";

<p align="center">
<img src = {pic11} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

</p>
<br />

_The [**Button and Instructions section**](button-instructions) is succesfully executed! Let's move on and see how we created the **[Footer](footer)** of the **[Fill My Cycle](https://fillmycycle.tcetmumbai.in)**._
