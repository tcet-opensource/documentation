# Header
The **Header** section is an informative element which is present at the top of every page of the website. It consists of **Fill My Cycle Header**, **Dark Theme Icon** and a **Interactive Theme changer Logo** making the overall interface of the webiste very convertible. Hence providing essential information and contributing to user-friendly experience. The **"Fill My Cycle"** Header, an artistic portrayal that speaks volumes, engaging the viewer in a captivating dialogue.

### Fill My Cycle Header
The header is located at the upper centre portion of the page.

**To display the fill my cycle header we need to follow the following steps:**

1. Opening the **index.html** file.

2. In this section our prime focus is to obtain the ***fill my cycle header*** this can be found  in the **index.html** code. Here we created different `<div>` classses for classifying different parts of codes and simply used html to type the logo enclosed under `<h3>` tag and also used **Styling** to obtain the blue color.
``` html title = "index.html" {3-4} showLineNumbers
    <div class="container">
	   <div class="top-container">
	      <header class="header">
		      <h3 class="title">Fill My Cycle</h3>  
``` 
3. ** After following the above steps the header looks like this.**
  
import rap from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/tos.png";

<center>
    <img src={rap} style={{ border: "2px solid gray"}} />
    <b><figcaption>Header Section</figcaption></b>
</center>
</figure>

### Theme changer

Making it very necessary for us as well to put theme changer to make user experience better and memorable. 

**Let's now understand it's code now:**

1. Firstly open **index.html** file.

2. Here we have created `<div>` class called `id` button which has its value as `DARK` and it redirects to **script.js** and this button follows the image showing an icon of half moon which on clicking leads us to the dark theme.

``` html title="index.html"{1-3} showLineNumbers
<div id="btn-mode">
			<div><p id="mode-text">DARK</p></div>
			<div><img id="mode-icon" src="./assets/icons/moon-icon.svg" alt=""></div>
</div>
```
3. Now let's open **script.js**.

4. Here we have used if-else statement here, if darkMode is equal to **false**, it means the dark mode is currently **off.** In that case, the `darkModeProp()` function is called. 

``` js title="script.js" {3,7,9-13,21,23} showLineNumbers
const root = document.documentElement.style;

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	let btnMode = document.getElementById('btn-mode');
	let modetext = document.getElementById("mode-text");
	const modeicon = document.getElementById("mode-icon")
	let darkMode = false;

	btnMode.addEventListener('click', function() {
		if (darkMode == false) {
			darkModeProp();
		  } else {
			lightModeProp();
		  }
	} );
```    

5. Function `darkModeProp` sets the style properties to define the dark mode appearance, updates the mode text to "LIGHT", changes the mode icon to a sun, and sets `darkMode` to **true** and uses the parameters given in the code. If `darkMode` is not equal to ***false*** it means dark mode is currently ***on.*** 

``` js title="script.js" {3,6,7,8} showLineNumbers
const root = document.documentElement.style;

	function darkModeProp() {
		root.setProperty("--lm-bg", "#131414");
		// It's followed by similar parameters defined to obtain Dark Theme
		modetext.innerText = "LIGHT";
		modeicon.src = "./assets/icons/sun-icon.svg";
		root.setProperty("--lm-icon-bg", "brightness(1000%)");
		darkMode = true;
		localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", true);
	}

```
:::tip
In the very same way we have also created for how to switch the user interface back to light mode, just changed the paramters values.

###  Help

1. The **Need Help** or the **Click here to see instructions** is provided just below the fill my cycle.

2. This is a clickable button which when the user clicks takes him directly to the **instructions components**

3. Now lets understand it's code by opening **index.html** file

4. Overall, the code represents a row with a form that has a heading saying **"Need Help?"** and a **button** when the user clicks leads him to instructions part.

5. The `<div>` class sets the styling and padding of the **Need Help** text , this text is followed by a clickable button.

``` html title="index.html"{5} showLineNumbers
<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-12">
			<form class="form-inline" action="" onsubmit="return false">
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mrg">Need Help? <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs instr-ref">Click here to see instructions</button></h5>
				</div>
``` 

** After adding the *fill my cycle header*, *theme changer button* and *need help button* the header will look something like this: **

import header from "/docs/projects/fmc-website/assets/cycle.png";

<figure>
    <img src={header} style={{ border: "2px solid gray"}} />
    <center><b><figcaption>Header Section</figcaption></b></center>
</figure>
<br />

_The [**Header Section**](header-help) is succesfully executed! Let's move on and see how we created the **[Defining cycles](defining-cycle)** of the **[Fill My Cycle](https://fillmycycle.tcetmumbai.in)**._
