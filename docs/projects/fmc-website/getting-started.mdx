2. For previewing the `script.js` file we can easily press **Run Code** or **ALt+Ctrl+N**, but this can only we used to show outputs, but in our case we also deal with inputs from the user.
3. So to resolve this issue we'll first open terminal and put the following command and hit enter.

```bash
npm install prompt-sync
```
4. Now we are all set to go, on running the code we'll get the preview as well the input promt in **Terminal**.
