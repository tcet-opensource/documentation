1. On opening the `index.html` file we can simply by right clicking on a HTML file from Explorer Window and **clicking on Open with Live server** or open a HTML file and ***right-click*** on the editor and click on **Open with Live Server** or can even use a shortcut **alt+L.**

2. For previewing the `script.js` file we can easily press **Run Code** or **ALt+Ctrl+N**, but this can only we used to show outputs, but in our case we also deal with inputs from the user.

3. So to resolve this issue we'll first open terminal and put the following command and hit enter.

    ```bash
    npm install prompt-sync
    ```

4. Now we are all set to go, on running the code we'll get the preview as well the input promt in **Terminal**.
