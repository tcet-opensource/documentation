The **"Calculate"** function in JavaScript takes a **table and an input field** as **parameters.** It retrieves the *numerical value from the input field and performs various checks and calculations.* If the value meets certain conditions, *it adjusts it, determines a level, distributes the difference, updates the table's cells with images, multiplies values,* and **returns an array.**The calculate function **performs various calculations** and **updates the table and arrays based on the input provided,** and *it returns an array of values (w) at the end.*

```jsx title="script.js" {3-4,6-7,9-12,15,22-25,55-56}showLineNumbers
function calculate(tbl,ip){
	var marks=parseFloat(ip.value);
	if(ip.value.length==2 && ip.value!="10" && marks<=20){
		ip.value=marks=20;
	}
	if(marks>100){
		ip.value=marks=100;
	}
	if(marks>=20 && marks<=100){
		if(marks%2!=0) {
			if(marks%2<1){
				marks=marks-marks%2;
			}
			else{
				marks+=(2-marks%2);
			}
			ip.value=marks;
		}
		var diff=0;
		var l=[5,5,5,5,5];
		var w=[6,6,2,2,4];
		var lvl=(marks-marks%20)/20+Math.ceil(marks%20/20);
		l[0]=l[1]=l[2]=l[3]=l[4]=lvl;
		if(marks%20!=0){
			diff=20-marks%20;
		}
		else{
			diff=0;
		}
		while(diff){
			if(diff>=6){
				l[1]--;
				diff-=6;
			}
			if(diff>=4){
				l[4]--;
				diff-=4;
			}
			if(diff>=2 && diff<=4){
				l[2]--;
				diff-=2;
			}
			if(diff>=6){
				l[0]--;
				diff-=6;
			}
			if(diff>=2){
				l[3]--;
				diff-=2;
			}
		}
		for(var i=0;i<5;i++) for(var j=1;j<6;j++)
			tbl.children[i].children[j].innerHTML="";
		for(var i=0;i<5;i++){
			tbl.children[i].children[6-l[i] ].innerHTML='<img src="./assets/images/check.png" style= "height:50px; width:60px;">';
			w[i]*=l[i];
		}
		w.push(marks);
		return w;
	}
	return false;
}
```


In the calculate function, the following operations are performed:

1. The **input value** is parsed as a **float and stored in the marks variable.** 

2. There are three conditional checks:

 The first condition checks if the *input value has a length of 2, is not equal to "10", and is less than or equal to 20.* If **true**, it **sets** both the **input value and marks to 20.**
 
 The second condition checks if *marks is greater than 100.* If true, it **sets** both the **input value and marks to 100.**
 
 The third condition checks if *marks is between 20 and 100 (inclusive).* If **true,** further calculations are performed.
    
    Inside the third condition:
    The **nested if condition checks** if *marks is an odd number.* If **true,** it adjusts **marks** to the ***nearest even number.*** If the *fractional part of marks is less than 1,* it **subtracts** it from marks to make it **even.** Otherwise, it adds *(2 - fractional part)* to marks to make it the next even number.

3. The diff variable is *initialized to 0.*

4. Arrays *l* and *w* are created with initial values `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` and `[6, 6, 2, 2, 4]` respectively.

5. The **lvl variable** is *calculated* as `(marks - marks % 20) / 20 + Math.ceil(marks % 20 / 20)`, which **determines** the **level based on marks.**

6. The values in array *l* are *updated to lvl* for all elements. The **diff variable** is *updated* based on the *remainder of marks divided by 20.*

7. Using a **while loop,** the *diff value is gradually reduced by updating the values in array l* based on certain conditions. A **nested loop** is used to **clear** the HTML **content of specific table cells.**

8. Another loop *updates the HTML content of specific table cells* with an ***image of a checkmark,*** based on the *values* in array *l*. The *values in array w* are *multiplied by the corresponding values in array l.*

9. The marks value is **added** to the **end of array w.** The array *w* is **returned.** If *none of the conditions are met, the function returns **false**.*
