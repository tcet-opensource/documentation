The `avg(tbl)` function **helps us find the average of numbers in a table**, make sure it's not too small, *adjust it to be an even number if needed,* and then *put the result in a specific input field.* Imagine you have a *special table with rows of numbers,* and you want to **find average of those numbers.** This function will help us with that.

```jsx title="script.js" {2-5,12-13,14}showLineNumbers
function avg(tbl){
	var s=0,n=tbl.children.length;
	for(var i=0;i<n;i++){
		if(tbl.children[i].lastElementChild.firstElementChild.value){
			s+= parseInt(tbl.children[i].lastElementChild.firstElementChild.value);
		}
		else{
			return false;
		}
	}
	s/=n;
	if(s<20) s=20;
	if(s%2!=0) {
		if(s%2<1){
			s=s-s%2;
		}
		else{
			s+=(2-s%2);
		}
	}
	if(tbl==$("#tbl01")[0]){
		$("#ip1").val(s);
	}
	else{
		$("#ip2").val(s);
	}
}

```
Now let's go through each lines of the code:

1.	We start by getting a table, which is like a special *chart with rows and columns.* We call this table `tbl`. It's the **table we want to work** with and **perform some actions on.**

2.	We *create two special variables,* **"s"** and **"n"**. `s` will help us keep **track of the sum of numbers,** and `n` will **keep track of how many rows there are in the table.** We start with *both variables set to 0.*

3.	Now, we go through each row of the table one by one. We ***start counting from 0*** and keep *going until we reach the last row.* For each row, we *do something special.*

4.	We *check if the first input field in the row has a value in it.* It's like looking at the box in that row and **seeing if there's a number inside.** If there is, we **take that number and add it to our sum variable "s".** But if there's **nothing inside the box,** we ***stop everything and return "false".*** It means *there's a problem,* like a missing number.

5.	After *going through all the rows*, **we divide the sum "s" by the total number of rows "n"** to find the ***average.*** It's like *adding up all the numbers and then dividing the total by how many numbers there are.*

6.	Next, we check if the **average is less than 20.** If it is, we **set it to 20.** It means that even if the average is really **small,** *it should be at least 20.*

7.	Now, we **check if the average is an odd number.** If it is, we *do some special adjustments to make it an even number.* If the average is *slightly less than an even number* (like 21.3), we **subtract the remainder** (in this case, 1) to make it an **even number** (20). But if the average is **slightly more** than an even number (like 22.7), **we add the difference** (in this case, 0.3) to make it the ***next even number*** (24).

8.	After *all these calculations*, we check which **table we were working with**. If it's a **table** called `tbl01`, we find a **special input** field called `ip1` and **put the average value there.** But if it's a different table, we find a **different input field called `ip2` ** and *put the average value there.*
