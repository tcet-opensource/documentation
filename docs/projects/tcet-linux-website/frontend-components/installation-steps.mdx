TCET Linux Installation Steps `element` is a step-by-step guide created by us that will walk you through the process of installing [**TCET Linux**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux/releases/download/v0.5-beta/checksum) on your system. We have included all the neccessary steps from **Initial Welcome Screen** to selecting your **Location**, **Keyboard Layout**, **Storage Partitioning**, and **User Details**. This `Section` in the [**TCET Linux Website**](https://linux.tcetmumbai.in/) helps the user to easily install `TCET Linux` on their Device.

**Here's how we implemented code of this `Element` :**

## Function Defination

1. Opening the [**"InstallationSteps.jsx"**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux-website/blob/main/src/components/InstallationSteps.jsx)file.

2. In **Installation Steps Element**, We have implemented a `code` that consist a `React` component called **InstallationSteps**. It is a functional component that renders a set of installation steps for **TCET Linux Installation** along with `Corresponding Images` with **Hovering Effect**.

  ``` jsx title="InstallationSteps.jsx" {1-2,11-12} showLineNumbers
//import dependencies
function InstallationSteps() 
    const [imageFirst, setImageFirst] = useState(welcomeImage);
    const [imageSecond, setImageSecond] = useState(welcomeImage);
    //Futher Code
  ```
3. Our implemented `code` begins with importing the necessary dependencies and several image files using relative paths for our `Requirements`.

4. We have defined **InstallationSteps** function as the component.

   - Inside the component, two **State Variables** are initialized using the `useState` hook: **imageFirst** and **imageSecond**.

   - The **imageFirst** `state` variable represents the image displayed on the `Left side`, and **imageSecond** represents the image displayed on the `Right` side.

## Array Defination 

1. In this `step`, we have defined an Two `Array` called **installationStepsFirstSet** and **installationStepsSecondSet**. These arrays contain objects representing the installation steps.

2. First **Array** contain the objects for `First Set` of Installation Steps component. Similarly Second **Array** contain the objects for `Second Set` of Installation Steps component.

 ```jsx title="InstallationSteps.jsx" {2,4-8} showLineNumbers
   //function defination
   const installationStepsFirstSet = 
    {
      id: 1,
      header: "Welcome Screen",
      description:
        "Launch the installer by searching for 'Install TCET Linux'. The installer will look like this.",
      image: welcomeImage,
    },
    //Futher code
 ```

3. Each step object has properties such as id, header, description, and image which represents step number, step title, step description, step image file path.

**Similar Steps were carried out by us to create different object in both the [Arrays](#array-defination).**

:::info
We created this `Arrays` to utilise in **Main** Structure, which shorten's the code length and make it accessible to understand.

:::tip
You can refer this code from **"InstallationSteps.jsx"** file from our [**TCET Linux Website**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux-website) repo.

## Sets of Installation Steps

This Component consist of the main Structure of code implemented by our team which enable the `Sets` section with `hovering image` effect.

   ``` jsx title="InstallationSteps.jsx" {2,6,7,8,11,12,15,16,19,21} showLineNumbers
   //Main Structure
<div id="installation" className="overflow-hidden bg-[#101828] py-4 px-4 lg:px-12">
 <div className="">
  <div className="py-12 px-6 w-full h-full flex flex-col-reverse xl:flex-row md:flex-row">
   <div className="w-full xl:w-1/2 relative">
    <p className="text-[#6172F3] font-bold">INSTALLATION GUIDE</p>
    <p className="font-title text-[#FCFCFD] text-2xl md:text-4xl pt-2 pb-2">
      TCET Linux Installation Steps
    </p>
    <div className="absolute z-30 top-14 left-0 w-48 h-80  bg-gradient-to-r from-teal-100 via-indigo-500 to-pink-100 opacity-30 blur-2xl flex-none order-4 rounded-xl transform -rotate-45"></div>
     <div onMouseLeave={() => setImageFirst(welcomeImage)}>
      {installationStepsFirstSet.map((step) => (
     <div
        className="pt-6 cursor-pointer text-sm sm:text-base"
        onMouseEnter={() => setImageFirst(step.image)}
        key={step.id}
       >
       <p className="text-[#98A2B3] font-semibold">
       {step.id}. {step.header}
       </p>
       <p className="text-[#F9FAFB] pt-2">{step.description}</p>
    </div>
                     ))}
   </div>
  </div>
      <div className="relative w-full flex justify-center align-middle xl:w-1/2">
        <div className="absolute z-30 top-5 w-48 h-52 xl:w-[600px] xl:h-[450px] bg-[#98A2B3] opacity-30 blur-2xl flex-none order-4 rounded-full"></div>
        <div className="z-50 flex align-middle rounded-xl m-2">
         <img className="w-full object-contain rounded-lg" src={imageFirst} />
        </div>
      </div>
 </div>
</div>
// Similar Set section Code
```

**Here's the explanation of the code : **

 1. We defined a JSX is wrapped in a `<div>` element with the id set to "installation" and some CSS classes for styling purposes. 

 2. Within the component, we defined the JSX structure which is divided into two main sections for the **first** and **second** sets of installation steps.

 3. In the first section, we created a `<div>` elements containing another div's for the left side content and the right side content.
 
 4. Inside the left side `<div>`, we created a paragragh tag (`<p>`) element for the title, a `<p>` element for the description of the installation guide and an `<img>` element that displays the image corresponding to the currently selected step. The `image` source is controlled by the **imageFirst** `state` variable.

 5. The **installationStepsFirstSet** `array` is mapped over to render each step as a `<div>`. The **onMouseEnter** event is used by us to update the **imageFirst** `state` variable with the corresponding image when a step is hovered over.

**Similar Steps were carried out to created another set of [InstallationSteps](#sets-of-installation-steps).**

:::tip
Using this Syntax of Javascript Language, Multiple Sets can be created as per your Requirements.
:::

**After implementing all components, the Installation Steps Component can be scene like this :**

import set1 from "/docs/projects/tcet-linux-website/assets/set1.jpg";

<figure>
    <center><img src={set1} style={{ border: "2px solid gray", width: "600px", height: "400px" }} /></center>
    <center><b><figcaption>Installation Steps Set 1</figcaption></b></center>
</figure>

import set2 from "/docs/projects/tcet-linux-website/assets/set2.jpg";

<figure>
    <center><img src={set2} style={{ border: "2px solid gray", width: "600px" , height: "400px" }} /></center>
    <center><b><figcaption>Installation Steps Set 2</figcaption></b></center>
</figure>

*In this page, we saw how the [**Installation Steps**](installation-steps) section was put together. Let's go on towards the next stage,the [**Verify Downloads**](verify-downloads) Section , to see how the component was implemented.*
