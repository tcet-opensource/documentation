The **Footer** elelment of [**TCET Linux Website**](https://linux.tcetmumbai.in/) which is located at the bottom of the website. It serves as a container for information that is relevant to the entire page. It acts as a `Navigation` and `Contact ` guide for users. In the Footer element, We have included links to [**Documentation**](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/category/projects/), [**Blogs**](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/blog/), **Live projects**, **Teams**, **Copyright Information**, [**Email address**](mailto:linux@tcetmumbai.in) for contact purposes with **TCET LINUX**, and icons linking to the Organization's presence on various social media platforms like [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tcet-opensource/), [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@TCETMumbaiOfficial), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/tcetopensource), [**Instagram**](https://www.instagram.com/tcetopensource/), and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/). We created this enhanced footer that helps users easily access relevant resources and connect with the **TCET Opensource Organisation** through multiple channels.

## Top Section

This Section is represented by the **HTML program** with **CSS** which consists of two components : **Logo Component** and **Footlinks Component**.

**Here is the implemented code :**

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {1,3} showLineNumbers
    <div class="sm:h-[210px] h-full py-6 px-5 sm:py-[48px] sm:px-[41px] border-t bg-[#101828] flex   font-sans gap-5 flex-col">
    //top section
    <div class=" w-full min-h-fit  flex flex-col sm:flex-row  justify-between items-center ">
    //futher sections code
  ```
We created the first `<div>` above as the parent div of the **Footer** element and the second `<div>` as the **Sectional div** for Top Section.

### Logo Component

This Component created by us, contains the **Logo** of the TCET Opensource Organization.

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {3,4} showLineNumbers
   //top section div
     <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
        <img src="/Footer/logo.png" alt="" class="h-[49px]" />
        <h2 class="text-white font-semibold text-2xl">TCET Open Source.</h2>
      </div>
   //Footlinks component code
  ```
  - `<img src>` tag is used by our team to import the logo and display it in the `<div>` created.
  - `<h2>` tag is created by us to display the name of the Orgnization.

:::tip
The Logo of the Orgnization can be updated by changing **img src** pathlink or the image in that path.

### Footlinks Component 

This Component produce by us, contains the **Footlinks** of the TCET Opensource Organization.

  ```jsx title="index.astro" {3-8} showLineNumbers
   //Logo Component code
   <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row  h-full gap-3 text-[#D0D5DD]  items-center">
    <a class="hover:underline font-thin  text-sm  " href="https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/category/projects" target="_blank">Docs</a>

    <a class="hover:underline font-thin  text-sm  " href="mailto:opensource@tcetmumbai.in">Contact</a>
   </div>
   //Bottom Section Code
  ```

** Explanation of the code :**

 1. An **`<a>`** tag is created by our team to give **Title** to the footlinks with **href** links corresponding to that **Footlinks**.
  
 2. There are some links created of different pages such as :

    <a class="  text-xs  text-[#D0D5DD]" href="mailto:linux@tcetmumbai.in">linux@tcetmumbai.in</a> 
  ```
  1. We created the First `<div>` as the Sectional div for Bottom Section.

  2. Second `<div>` is created to display the Copyright text of this componenet.

      <a href="https://github.com/tcet-opensource/" target="_blank"><img src="/Footer/Github.png" alt="" class="h-5 cursor-pointer" /></a>
    </div>
 ```
1. We have used Basic HTML syntax in this component to fulfill our requirements .

2. The `<a>` tag is used by us to display LinkedIn Platform link in **href** of TCET OpenSource Organization .

3. Similarly using same syntax, we have linked different Social Media Platform Account of TCET OpenSource Organization for contact process of user.

:::tip
Using similar Basic HTML syntax, more **Social Media** links can be added in the Bottom Component of Footer Element of the Website. 
:::

**After adding all components, the Footer Element can be scene like this :**

import footer from "/docs/projects/tcet-linux-website/assets/footer.jpg";


<figure>
    <img src={footer} style={{ border: "2px solid gray"}} />
    <center><b><figcaption>Footer Section</figcaption></b></center>
</figure>

_After successfully implementing the [**Footer component**](footer) of the [**TCET Linux Website**](https://linux.tcetmumbai.in/) , the next step is to move forward with the implementation of the [**Copy to Clipboard component**](copy-to-clipboard)._
