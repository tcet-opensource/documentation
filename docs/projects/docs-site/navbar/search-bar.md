### Adding a search bar

We are continuously working on improving our website to provide the best user experience. As part of this effort, we will be adding a **search bar functionality** in the near future. 

This feature will make it easy for users to access the documentations and blogs on our website. Thank you for your patience and support as we strive to make our website more user-friendly and professional.

> **Here are the steps we plan to take to implement this functionality:**

1. Installing the `@docusaurus/plugin-search-local` package:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev @docusaurus/plugin-search-local
    ```
2. Adding the plugin to our `docusaurus.config.js` file:

    ```js title="docusaurus.config.js" {3-15} showLineNumbers
    module.exports = {
        // ...
        plugins: [
            [
                '@docusaurus/plugin-search-local',
                {
                    indexDocs: true, // Whether to index docs pages
                    indexBlog: true, // Whether to index blog pages
                    indexPages: true, // Whether to index static pages
                    docsRouteBasePath: '/docs', // Base path for the docs route
                    blogRouteBasePath: '/blog', // Base path for the blog route
                    language: ['en'], // Supported languages
                },
            ],
        ],
        // ...
        };
    ```

3. Adding the search bar to the navbar in our `themeConfig` file:

    ```js title="docusaurus.config.js" {10-11} showLineNumbers
    module.exports = {
        // ...
        themeConfig: {
            // ...
            navbar: {
                // ...
                items: [
                    // ...
                    {
                        type: 'search',
                        position: 'right',
                    },
                ],
            },
        },
        // ...
    };
    ```

4. Building our site:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. Running our site:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```



## Congratulations 🎊

Following these steps and points, we were able to create a beautiful and interactive navbar . It's final structure looks something like this:

import heroImg from "../navbar/assets/navbar-1.png";

<img src={heroImg} />

<br />
<br />

_With this, we are pleased to announce that the **navbar feature has been successfully added to the our organizations's website**. You may have noticed that the navbar has a number of helpful links and features that make it simple to navigate the documentation._

We are convinced that by including search capabilities in the navbar, our users will reach the documentation and blog entries even more easily.
