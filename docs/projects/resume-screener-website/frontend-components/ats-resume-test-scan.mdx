The **ATS Resume Test/Scan section** provides a free ATS resume scan. It was built with all applicant tracking systems in mind and acts as a powerful ATS resume test.

**The section can be broken down into the following divisions:**

### Header and Tip
**We followed these steps to make the same:**
1. Creating a `<div>` element with two child `<p>` elements inside it. 
2. The first `<p>` element displays the heading, and the second `<p>` element provides a tip. 

```jsx title="index.astro" {2-3,5-9} showLineNumbers
    <div class="p-0 md:w-[50%]">
        <p class="text-[#FCFCFD] text-3xl font-rubik">
            Find out if your resume passes ATS resume test
        </p>
        <p class="text-[#D0D5DD] py-4">
            Tip: Score My Resume was bult with all applicant racking
            systems in mind and acts as a powerful ATS resume test, ts
            scanned correctly by our platform, you can be confident it
            wil also be processed correctly by all ATS.
        </p>       
```   
**The header and tip look like this:**

import pic from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/header and title.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={pic} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

:::info
We used CSS classes to style the elements, setting properties such as color, font size, padding, and font family.

### Resume scan button and image 
**We followed these steps:**
1. We made a `<button>` element with a class assigned to it. The class contains multiple CSS properties for styling.
2. The content was added inside the `<button>` element: "**Get Your Free ATS Resume Scan**". This is the text displayed within the button.            
 

```jsx title="index.astro" {2,3} showLineNumbers
    <button
        class="bg-[#6938ef] hover:bg-[#6533ed] text-white py-2 px-5 md:py-3 md:px-8 rounded-lg mt-4">
            Get Your Free ATS Resume Scan
    </button>
```
**The resume scan button looks like this:**

import button from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/resume scan button.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={button} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

3. We imported a specific file named "**Group 1.svg**" and assigned it to a variable called **Group1**

```jsx title="index.astro" {} showLineNumbers
import Group1 from "/ATSResumeTest/Group 1.svg";
```

4. The image is positioned absolutely and styled with CSS classes to set its width, maintain its aspect ratio, and position it relative to its parent container.

```jsx title="index.astro" {2-3} showLineNumbers
    <img
        src={Group1}
        class="absolute w-[50%] h-auto right-[-6rem] bottom-[-12rem]"
    />
```

After combining all of the divisions, the **Resume Test/Scan** section can be seen like this:

import section from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/resume test-scan section.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={section} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

*The **[ATS Resume Test/Scan section](ats-resume-test-scan)** is succesfully executed! Let's move on and see how we created the **[Features Section](features)** of the **[Resume Screener Website](https://rs.tcetmumbai.in/)**.*
