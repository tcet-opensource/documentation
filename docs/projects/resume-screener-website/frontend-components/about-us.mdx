The **About Us** page of the website will help you discover our story, mission, and values as an organization. It can be accessed through the navigation bar of the [**Resume Screener Website**](https://rs.tcetmumbai.in/).

**Here are the steps on how we integrated the Option to take the resume test in About Us Component**

## Adding About Us

1. Opening **aboutUs.astro** file in our projects root directory.

2. We then created a section element `section` that would represent the content section. Under this we assigned CSS classes to introduce the required details. 

    ```jsx title="aboutUs.astro" {1} showLineNumbers
    <section class="w-full bg-[#0C1030] box-border flex justify-between gap-6 lg:gap-12  flex-col lg:flex-row p-4 lg:p-16 ">
    ```

3. We created a div element `div` to hold an image on the left side of the section. Inside the div, we added an image element `img` that displays the `aboutUsImg` image.

    ```jsx title="aboutUs.astro" {2} showLineNumbers
    <div class=" w-full flex align-center lg:w-1/2 ">
        <img src = {aboutUsImg} alt="about-us" class="w-full"/>
    </div>

**On implementation, the image section would look like this:**

import aboutUsImg from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/aboutUsImg.png";

<center><img src={aboutUsImg} style={{ border: "2px solid gray", width: "500px" }} /></center>

<br />

4. Then we created another div element `div` to hold text and a button on the right side of the section. Inside this div, we added a span element `span` to display the title **"About Us"**. Similarly we added another span element to display a **paragraph** describing the purpose of the resume scanner. 

    ```jsx title="aboutUs.astro" {3-5} showLineNumbers
    // About image section
    <div class=" w-full flex flex-col items-start   gap-2 lg:gap-6 lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/2">
        <span class=" text-4xl md:text-5xl font-semibold leading-14 text-[#FCFCFD] ">About Us</span>
        <span class="md:text-lg font-normal leading-7 text-[#D0D5DD]">

        </span>
    ```

## Adding Resume test button

1. We added a button element `button` to provide a call-to-action. 

2. Inside the button, we added an image element `img` to display the arrow icon. 

    ```jsx title="aboutUs.astro" {1-3} showLineNumbers
        <button class=" flex flex-row align-start px-4 py-2.5 gap-1.5 bg-[#6938EF] hover:bg-[#3708b7] transition-colors text-[#FFFFFF] rounded">Start Resume Test
                <img src={arrow} class="p-1"></img>
        </button>
    ```

**On executing the above steps, the buttom looks like this:**

import testButton from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/test-button.png";

<img src={testButton} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />

**Once we exceuted this steps, the about us section looked like this:**

import aboutUs from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/aboutUs.png";

<img src={aboutUs} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />
<br />


_The [**About Us Section**](about-us) is succesfully executed! Let's move on and see how we created the [**Guidelines Component**](guideline) of the **[Resume Screener Website](https://rs.tcetmumbai.in)**._
