### Adding Star Resume Test Option

**Here are the steps on how we integrated the Option to take the resume test in About Us Component**

1. Opening `about-us.svg` file in our projects root directory.

2. Declared a functional component called `AboutUs` having it's `<button>` element along with the text and pictorial component of about us section.

    ```jsx title="about-us.svg"
        <button class=" flex flex-row align-start px-4 py-2.5 gap-1.5 bg-[#6938EF] hover:bg-[#3708b7] transition-colors text-[#FFFFFF] rounded">Start Resume Test
            <img src={arrow} class="p-1"></img>
        </button>
    ```
3. Save all the changes.

4. Run `yarn dev` on the terminal to see the changes made in your local environment. 

**On executing the above steps, the button looks like this:**

import Staff_img from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/tos-logo.png";

<img src={Staff_img} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} />

<br />

_After successfully implementing the **[About Us](about-us)** component of the **[Resume Screener Website](https://rs.tcetmumbai.in/)** website, now let's move forward with the implementation of **[ATS Resume Template](ats-resume-template)** component._
