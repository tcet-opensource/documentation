The **Guidelines** section provides some guidelines that a user can follow to ensure that their resume gets correctly scanned by all applicant tracking systems.

**The section can be broken down into the following divisions:**

### Guidelines accordion
**We followed these steps to make the same:**
1. We used **TypeScript** declaration to initialize a constant variable named `accordions` with a value of an `array` of objects. Each object in the `array` represents a guideline and has two properties: `title` and `data`. 
2. The `Guidelines[]` type suggests that `accordions` is an `array` containing objects that adhere to the structure defined by the **Guidelines** type.

  ```jsx title="guidelines.tsx" {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
  const accordions: Guidelines[] =[
      {
        title:"Avoid using tables",
        data : "Label your work experience and education sections with conventional section titles"
      },
      {
      <!--Other guidelines' title and data-->
      },
    ];
  ```

:::tip
Similar steps were carried out to add `title` and `data` of other guidelines.
:::

3. We used a **JavaScript** expression to map over the `accordions array`. For each object in the `array`, it returned a **JSX** element representing an `accordion` item.

  ```jsx title="accordion.jsx" {} showLineNumbers
  {
                accordions.map(({ title, data, open }) => (
  ```

4. The `open` attribute is set based on the `open` property of the current item in the `accordions array`. 

5. The class attribute defines the **CSS** classes for styling the `accordion` item, and the style attribute sets inline styles for the background gradient.

  ```jsx title="accordion.jsx" {2-3,5-9} showLineNumbers
  <details open={open} class="border-box rounded-md p-1 group border border-[#667085]" style="background: linear-gradient(116.05deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25) 21.76%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.0875) 119.92%);">
  ```

6. We used a **JSX** element to represent the heading part of the `accordion` item and used the `<summary>` HTML tag to define the heading.

7. `{title}` was used to insert the `title` property of the current accordion item within the heading and `{data}` was used to insert the `data` property. 

8. **JavaScript** expression was used to insert an `<img>` element within the heading for the `down arrow`.

9. The class attribute defines **CSS** classes for styling the image, including a `group-open:rotate-180` class that applies a rotation transform when the `accordion` item is open.

  ```jsx title="accordion.jsx" {1-3,7} showLineNumbers
  <summary class="flex items-center justify-between  text-white p-3 px-6 text-sm">
                      {title}
                      {<img src="../GuidelinesSection/Icon.svg" alt="Down arrow" class="h-4 w-4  group-open:rotate-180 "/>}
                    </summary>
                    <div class="p-4">
                    <p class="text-white box-content font-inter text-sm ">
                      {data}
                    </p>
                    </div>
                  </details>
                ))
  ```

<p align="center">
<img src={accordion1} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

import accordion2 from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/accordion2.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={accordion2} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>



### Header and Intro
**We followed these steps to make the same:**
1. We used a `div` element with class names which contains the content displayed within the section.
2. `<p>` element was used to define text styling and display the **header** text "**How do I Make sure my resume is ATS-compliant?**". 
3. Another `<p>` element was used to display additional text providing the **intro**. 

```jsx title="header.jsx" {,2,4} showLineNumbers
<div class="text-white text-center">
      <p class="text-2xl sm:text-4xl font-rubik tracking-tight font-semibold">How do I Make sure my resume is <br>ATS-compliant?
        </p>
        <p class="text-md sm:text-lg font-light mt-2">Here are some guidelines you should follow to ensure your <br> resume gets correctly scanned by all applicant tracking<br> systems.</p>
    </div>
```
**Header and Intro:**

import header from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/header and intro.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={header} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

:::info
 We made use of a section element with multiple class names and a style attribute to set the padding, background image, and background color for the section.
::: 


After combining all of the divisions, the **Guidelines** section can be seen like this:

**Guidelines section:**

import guidelines from "/docs/projects/resume-screener-website/assets/guidelines.png";

<p align="center">
<img src={guidelines} style={{ border: "2px solid gray" }} /> 
</p>

*The **[Guidelines section](guideline)** has been executed successfully! Let's see how we created the **[ATS Resume template section](ats-resume-template)** of the **[Resume Screener Website](https://rs.tcetmumbai.in/)**.*
